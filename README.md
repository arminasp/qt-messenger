## Messenger made in Qt C++

This messenger implements client-server architecture. The code is for both client and server. SQLite is integrated for keeping messages and contact list. 

## Use

For demonstration purposes messenger can be opened in release/client/Client.exe . It connects to a running dedicated server. Otherwise, both server and client can be built in Qt Creator with 'server_ip' variable set to '127.0.0.1'.
